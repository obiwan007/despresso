## Community credits

We are based the work of the project on a lot of tings the decent community developed over time. Sometimes it is hard where ideas were actually coming from so ping me if I missed someone here.

### Base idea
First of all I want to thank Mimoja/flupresso (https://github.com/Mimoja/flupresso) for the initial (probably first) implementation of an app for Flutter. I used this project to kick off the basics of despresso. (Sorry not for giving you a note upfront).

As this project is already gone a bit off from the initial ideas - a few code fragments you will probably still find. Especially a lot of work was done from Mimoja for making the Acaia scales work in open source projects. I guess a lot of projects now profit from this research.

Another great project (https://github.com/AndyZap/De1Win10) was the base for actually understanding the parsing/decoding of profiles and basic communication with the de1 machine.
### Concepts
We used a olot of concepts invented by other people so we just want to thank and name them here:

* The JSON format for profiles was developed from Jeff (https://github.com/jeffsf/pyDE1) which has a very nice project (pyde1) for the decent de1 here too. If something was not working as expected there is always someone who already solved it in one ore the other way. The JSON format was already incorporated into the Decent de1app as one of the used export/import formats.

* Enrique Bengoechea (https://github.com/ebengoechea) is the guy who contributed the original idea to describe coffee in the original de1app. So we took this base idea and added it as a slightly different concept via our recipes thing.

* Thanks to Miha Rekar (https://github.com/miharekar) for creating the https://visualizer.coffee/ project which helps the community a lot to share and compare espresso shots. He provides the backbone and base infrastructure to make this happen.

* Thanks to Lars Saalbach (https://github.com/graphefruit) and all other contributors for Beanconqueror. It is a great app and the broad range of supported devices offer a good option for reference implementations.

* Basecamp (decent diaspora) and Discord is always fun to read about all kind of stuff about the de1 product and many of the ideas about UI and UX flows coming from different sources here. Discussing with users about broken/missing features helped alot to make the app more usable. Hard to actually credit the original work here unfortunately.

## Special thanks
to the funding campaign contributors who actually made it possible to go this far with the project. Buying devices for integrations is rather expansive and if enabled us to go forward.

Patreon just starts and it might be a way to push the project forward even if there is no other monetarisation used inside the corresponding appstores.
Thanks to the people wo joined the Patreons so soon.
I think Patreon gives a way better interaction option with the users of the app. We will see if it makes sense. 

John and Ray from decent were a huge help for getting forward. John was one of the first guys who sponsored us via funding. I had alot of long night discussions with Ray to get ideas and insights about how everything in the de1 holds together now and in the future. Ray is the inventor/developer of CafeHub which we might use in the future to communicate with the de1 machine.

## Corporations

* as mentioned before - thx John for providing some funding and basically creating the machine with his team to begin with.

* Atomax for providing us with a free Skale2. We tried to contact alot of companies but Atomax was completely friction free and just send us one over. Kudos for helping out the community.

* Google for providing Flutter which made this app possible from the first place.

* A lot of contributors for libraries in the dart/flutter ecosystem (they are aotomatically listed in the about dialog inside the app - based on the pubspec).

## The Team
Last but not least credits to @randomcoffeesnob who actually helped out as the first developer actually contributing to the project directly via working on the actual codebase. Also taking care of documentations is alot of work he did too.

A few guys also started helping out with localizations for other languages. We hope to extend this step by step over time.

## Disclaimer

I might have missed some people who contributer directly or indirectly to this project. Please feel free to contact me and you will be added to the list.
